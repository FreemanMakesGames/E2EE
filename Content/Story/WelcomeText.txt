Hello, welcome to Private Communication!
Alice and Bob are friends. They talk to each other often.
But they live continents away, and have to do so through a Messenger in the middle.
Messenger always does his job. But unfortunately, he likes reading other people's private words.
Sometimes, he even modifies the message, and impersonates others!
This time, Alice needs to get a secret message into Bob's hand.
They can't let Messenger have access to it!
Can you help them communicate in a private and secure manner?
The tools you have are: Lock, Key, and Container.
In addition to Destroying and Dropping items, everyone in this world can also "Duplicate" items.
That's all you need to know. Good luck!
