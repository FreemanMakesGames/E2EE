Hello, welcome to Private Communication!
You are invited to solve a puzzle:
Alice and Bob are friends. They talk to each other often.
But they live continents away, so a Messenger delivers their messages.
Messenger is good at his job. But unfortunately, he always saves a copy of each message.
He has access to everyone's private conversations!
Alice and Bob think it's time to end Messenger's eavesdropping.
Can you help them communicate in a private and secure manner?
