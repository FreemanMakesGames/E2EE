Bob receives the message, while Messenger fails to intercept it.
You win!
This game comes from the idea of what's called "asymmetric encryption", which is widely used for secure communication online.
In asymmetric encryption, everyone has a pair of "public key" ( the in-game lock ), and "private key" ( the in-game key ).
A user shares her public key online, so anyone can encrypt ( lock ) a message with her public key, and send her the encrypted messaege.
Having received the encrypted message, the user can then decrypt ( unlock ) it with her private key.
In a beautiful way, only the author and the recipient of the message can access its content.
Nobody else, be it government agencies, cyber criminals, or even cable companies who deliver the message, can read the message.
However, there's a catch in this game...
In real world, a user's private key is never shared with anyone.
Giving other people access to one's private key is a catastrophe.
But for this game, it can be beaten in a way where Alice sends Bob her private key ( key 'A' ), in a container locked by Bob's public key ( lock 'B' ).
It isn't discovered until the project is almost finished.
This solution will work in real world too. It will just be really bad.
So... This game is in fact a flawed educational/informational game.
But I still hope it's worth your time!
Thanks for playing, and see you in my next ( likely flawed ) project!
