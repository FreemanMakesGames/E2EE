Bob receives the message, while Messenger fails to intercept it.
You win!
What you just solved, is not only the problem of private communication between the fictional Alice and Bob.
People in real-life can be benefited just the same!
In fact, this solution is a backbone concept behind what's called "end-to-end encryption", widely used among our online activities.
It is there when we visit a website, do online banking, or retrieve a health report.
The "Messenger", i.e. the Internet Service Providers like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, can only deliver the messages, but not peek the contents.
Neither can government agencies, or cyber criminals.
Isn't it beautiful?
Thanks for playing this informational game. See you next time!
